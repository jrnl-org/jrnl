Feature: Writing new entries.

    Scenario Outline: Multiline entry with punctuation should keep title punctuation 
        Given we use the config "<config_file>.yaml"
        And we use the password "bad doggie no biscuit" if prompted
        When we run "jrnl This is. the title\\n This is the second line"
        And we run "jrnl -n 1"
        Then the output should contain "This is. the title"

        Examples: configs
        | config_file  |
        | simple       |
        | empty_folder |
        | dayone       |
        | encrypted    |

    Scenario Outline: Single line entry with period should be split at period
        Given we use the config "<config_file>.yaml"
        And we use the password "test" if prompted
        When we run "jrnl This is. the title"
        And we run "jrnl -1"
        Then the output should contain "| the title"

        | basic_encrypted |
        | basic_folder    |

    Scenario Outline: Writing an entry from command line should store the entry
        Given we use the config "<config_file>.yaml"
        And we use the password "bad doggie no biscuit" if prompted
        When we run "jrnl 23 july 2013: A cold and stormy day. I ate crisps on the sofa."
        Then we should see the message "Entry added"
        When we run "jrnl -n 1"
        Then the output should contain "2013-07-23 09:00 A cold and stormy day."

        Examples: configs
        | config_file  |

    Scenario Outline: Writing an empty entry from the editor should yield "Nothing saved to file" message
        Given we use the config "<config_file>.yaml"
        And we use the password "test" if prompted
        When we open the editor and enter nothing
        Then the error output should contain "[Nothing saved to file]"

        Examples: configs
        | config_file         |
