        Welcome to jrnl {version}!

        It looks like you've been using an older version of jrnl until now. That's
        okay - jrnl will now upgrade your configuration and journal files. Afterwards
        you can enjoy all of the great new features that come with jrnl 2:

        - Support for storing your journal in multiple files
        - Faster reading and writing for large journals
        - New encryption back-end that makes installing jrnl much easier
        - Tons of bug fixes

        Please note that jrnl 1.x is NOT forward compatible with this version of jrnl.
        If you choose to proceed, you will not be able to use your journals with
        older versions of jrnl anymore.
