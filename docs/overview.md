# Overview

## What is jrnl?

`jrnl` is a simple journal application for
your command line. Journals are stored as human readable plain text
files - you can put them into a Dropbox folder for instant syncing and
you can be assured that your journal will still be readable in 2050,
when all your fancy iPad journal applications will long be forgotten.

Optionally, your journal can be encrypted using the [256-bit
AES](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard).

## Why keep a journal?

Journals aren't just for people who have too much
time on their summer vacation. A journal helps you to keep track of the
things you get done and how you did them. Your imagination may be
limitless, but your memory isn't.

For personal use, make it a good habit to write at least 20 words a day.
Just to reflect what made this day special, why you haven't wasted it.

For professional use, consider a text-based journal to be the perfect
complement to your GTD todo list - a documentation of what and how
you've done it. Or use it as a quick way to keep a change log. Or use it
to keep a lab book.
