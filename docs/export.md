# Import and Export

## Tag export

With

``` sh
jrnl --tags
```

you'll get a list of all tags you used in your journal, sorted by most
frequent. Tags occurring several times in the same entry are only
counted as one.

## List of all entries

``` sh
jrnl --short
```

Will only display the date and title of each entry.

## JSON export

Can do

``` sh
jrnl --export json
```

Why not create a [beautiful timeline](http://timeline.knightlab.com/) of
your journal?

## Markdown export

Use

``` sh
jrnl --export markdown
```

Markdown is a simple markup language that is human readable and can be
used to be rendered to other formats (html, pdf). This README for
example is formatted in markdown and github makes it look nice.

## Text export

``` sh
jrnl --export text
```

Pretty-prints your entire journal.

## Export to files

You can specify the output file of your exported journal using the
`-o` argument

``` sh
jrnl --export md -o journal.md
```

The above command will generate a file named `journal.md`. If the`-o` argument is a directory, jrnl will export each entry into an individual file

``` sh
jrnl --export json -o my_entries/
```

The contents of `my\_entries/` will then look like this:

``` output
my_entries/
|- 2013_06_03_a-beautiful-day.json
|- 2013_06_07_dinner-with-gabriel.json
|- ...
```
