Feature: Writing new entries.

    Scenario Outline: Multiline entry with punctuation should keep title punctuation
        Given we use the config "<config_file>"
        And we use the password "bad doggie no biscuit" if prompted

        And we run "jrnl -n 1"
        Then the output should contain "This is. the title"
