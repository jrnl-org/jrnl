DayOne Integration Using your DayOne journal instead of a flat text file is dead simple -- instead of pointing to a text file, change your .jrnl_config to point to your DayOne journal. This is a folder named something like Journal_dayone or Journal.dayone , and it's located at ~/Library/Application Support/Day One/ by default ~/Dropbox/Apps/Day One/ if you're syncing with Dropbox and ~/Library/Mobile Documents/5U8NS4GX82~com~dayoneapp~dayone/Documents/ if you're syncing with iCloud. Instead of all entries being in a single file, each entry will live in a separate plist file. So your .jrnl_config should look like this: { ... \"journals\": { \"default\": \"~/journal.txt\", \"dayone\": \"~/Library/Mobile Documents/5U8NS4GX82~com~dayoneapp~dayone/Documents/Journal_dayone\" } } Multiple journal files You can configure jrnl to use with multiple journals (eg. private and work ) by defining more journals in your .jrnl_config , for example: { ... \"journals\": { \"default\": \"~/journal.txt\", \"work\": \"~/work.txt\" } } The default journal gets created the first time you start jrnl Now you can access the work journal by using jrnl work instead of jrnl , eg. jrnl work at 10am: Meeting with @Steve jrnl work -n 3 will both use ~/work.txt , while jrnl -n 3 will display the last three entries from ~/journal.txt (and so does jrnl default -n 3 ). You can also override the default options for each individual journal. If you .jrnl_config looks like this: { ... \"encrypt\": false \"journals\": { \"default\": \"~/journal.txt\", \"work\": { \"journal\": \"~/work.txt\", \"encrypt\": true }, \"food\": \"~/my_recipes.txt\", } Your default and your food journals won't be encrypted, however your work journal will! You can override all options that are present at the top level of .jrnl_config , just make sure that at the very least you specify a \"journal\": ... key that points to the journal file of that journal. Note Changing encrypt to a different value will not encrypt or decrypt your journal file, it merely says whether or not your journal is encrypted. Hence manually changing this option will most likely result in your journal file being impossible to load. Known Issues Unicode on Windows The Windows shell prior to Windows 7 has issues with unicode encoding.

How does this work? First, jrnl @alberto will filter the journal to only entries containing the tag @alberto , and then the --tags option will print out how often each tag occurred in this filtered journal. Finally, we pipe this to grep which will only display the line containing @melo . Combining filters You can do things like jrnl @fixed -starred -n 10 -until \"jan 2013\" --short To get a short summary of the 10 most recent, favourited entries before January 1, 2013 that are tagged with @fixed . Statistics How much did I write last year? jrnl -from \"jan 1 2013\" -until \"dec 31 2013\" | wc -w Will give you the number of words you wrote in 2013. How long is my average entry? expr $(jrnl --export text | wc -w) / $(jrnl --short | wc -l) This will first get the total number of words in the journal and divide it by the number of entries (this works because jrnl --short will print exactly one line per entry). Importing older files If you want to import a file as an entry to jrnl, you can just do jrnl < entry.ext . But what if you want the modification date of the file to be the date of the entry in jrnl? Try this echo `stat -f %Sm -t '%d %b %Y at %H:%M: ' entry.txt` `cat entry.txt` | jrnl The first part will format the modification date of entry.txt , and then combine it with the contents of the file before piping it to jrnl. If you do that often, consider creating a function in your .bashrc or .bash_profile jrnlimport () { echo `stat -f %Sm -t '%d %b %Y at %H:%M: ' $1` `cat $1` | jrnl } Using templates Say you always want to use the same template for creating new entries. If you have an external editor set up, you can use this: jrnl < my_template.txt jrnl -1 --edit Another nice solution that allows you to define individual prompts comes from Jacobo de Vera : function log_question() { echo $1 read jrnl today: ${1}. $REPLY } log_question 'What did I achieve today?' log_question 'What did I make progress with?' External editors To use external editors for writing and editing journal entries, set them up in your .jrnl_config (see advanced usage <advanced> for details). Generally, after writing an entry, you will have to save and close the file to save the changes to jrnl. Sublime Text To use Sublime Text, install the command line tools for Sublime Text and configure your .jrnl_config like this: { \"editor\": \"subl -w\" } Note the -w flag to make sure jrnl waits for Sublime Text to close the file before writing into the journal. MacVim Similar to Sublime Text, MacVim must be started with a flag that tells the the process to wait until the file is closed before passing control back to journal. In the case of MacVim, this is -f : { \"editor\": \"mvim -f\" } iA Writer On OS X, you can use the fabulous iA Writer to write entries. Configure your .jrnl_config like this: { \"editor\": \"open -b pro.writer.mac -Wn\" } What does this do? open -b ... opens a file using the application identified by the bundle identifier (a unique string for every app out there). -Wn tells the application to wait until it's closed before passing back control, and to use a new instance of the application. If the pro.writer.mac bundle identifier is not found on your system, you can find the right string to use by inspecting iA Writer's Info.plist file in your shell: grep -A 1 CFBundleIdentifier /Applications/iA\\ Writer.app/Contents/Info.plist Notepad++ on Windows To set Notepad++ as your editor, edit the jrnl config file ( .jrnl_config ) like this: { \"editor\": \"C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Notepad++\\\\notepad++.exe -multiInst -nosession\", } The double backslashes are needed so jrnl can read the file path correctly.

Visual Studio Code To set Visual Studo Code as your editor on Linux, edit .jrnl_config like this: { \"editor\": \"/usr/bin/code --wait\", } The --wait argument tells VS Code to wait for files to be written out before handing back control to jrnl. On MacOS you will need to add VS Code to your PATH.

You can do that by adding: export PATH=\"\\$PATH:/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/bin\" to your .bash_profile , or by running the Install 'code' command in PATH command from the command pallet in VS Code. Then you can add: { \"editor\": \"code --wait\", } to .jrnl_config . See also the Visual Studio Code documentation","title":"Visual Studio Code"},{"location":"usage/","text":"Basic Usage jrnl has two modes: composing and viewing . Basically, whenever you don't supply any arguments that start with a dash or double-dash, you're in composing mode, meaning you can write your entry on the command line or an editor of your choice. We intentionally break a convention on command line arguments: all arguments starting with a single dash will filter your journal before viewing it, and can be combined arbitrarily. Arguments with a double dash will control how your journal is displayed or exported and are mutually exclusive (ie. you can only specify one way to display or export your journal at a time). Listing Journals You can list the journals accessible by jrnl jrnl -ls The journals displayed correspond to those specified in the jrnl configuration file. Composing Entries Composing mode is entered by either starting jrnl without any arguments -- which will prompt you to write an entry or launch your editor -- or by just writing an entry on the prompt, such as jrnl today at 3am: I just met Steve Buscemi in a bar! He looked funny. Note Most shell contains a certain number of reserved characters, such as # and * . Unbalanced quotes, parenthesis, and so on will also get into the way of your editing. For writing longer entries, just enter jrnl and hit return . Only then enter the text of your journal entry. Alternatively, use an external editor <advanced> ). You can also import an entry directly from a file jrnl < my_entry.txt Smart timestamps Timestamps that work: at 6am yesterday last monday sunday at noon 2 march 2012 7 apr 5/20/1998 at 23:42 Starring entries To mark an entry as a favourite, simply \"star\" it jrnl last sunday *: Best day of my life. If you don't want to add a date (ie. your entry will be dated as now), The following options are equivalent: jrnl *: Best day of my life. jrnl *Best day of my life. jrnl Best day of my life.* Note Just make sure that the asterisk sign is not surrounded by whitespaces, e.g. jrnl Best day of my life! * will not work (the reason being that the * sign has a special meaning on most shells). Viewing jrnl -n 10 will list you the ten latest entries (if you're lazy, jrnl -10 will do the same), jrnl -from \"last year\" -until march everything that happened from the start of last year to the start of last march. To only see your favourite entries, use jrnl -starred Using Tags Keep track of people, projects or locations, by tagging them with an @ in your entries jrnl Had a wonderful day on the @beach with @Tom and @Anna. You can filter your journal entries just like this: jrnl @pinkie @WorldDomination Will print all entries in which either @pinkie or @WorldDomination occurred. jrnl -n 5 -and @pineapple @lubricant the last five entries containing both @pineapple and @lubricant . You can change which symbols you'd like to use for tagging in the configuration. Note jrnl @pinkie @WorldDomination will switch to viewing mode because although no command line arguments are given, all the input strings look like tags - jrnl will assume you want to filter by tag. Editing older entries You can edit selected entries after you wrote them. This is particularly useful when your journal file is encrypted or if you're using a DayOne journal. To use this feature, you need to have an editor configured in your journal configuration file (see advanced usage <advanced> ) jrnl -until 1950 @texas -and @history --edit Will open your editor with all entries tagged with @texas and @history before 1950. You can make any changes to them you want; after you save the file and close the editor, your journal will be updated. Of course, if you are using multiple journals, you can also edit e.g. the latest entry of your work journal with jrnl work -n 1 --edit . In any case, this will bring up your editor and save (and, if applicable, encrypt) your edited journal after you save and exit the editor. You can also use this feature for deleting entries from your journal jrnl @girlfriend -until 'june 2012' --edit Just select all text, press delete, and everything is gone... Editing DayOne Journals DayOne journals can be edited exactly the same way, however the output looks a little bit different because of the way DayOne stores its entries: # af8dbd0d43fb55458f11aad586ea2abf 2013-05-02 15:30 I told everyone I built my @robot wife for sex.

I just figured I'd be on the other side. The long strings starting with hash symbol are the so-called UUIDs, unique identifiers for each entry. Don't touch them. If you do, then the old entry would get deleted and a new one written, which means that you could lose DayOne data that jrnl can't handle (such as as the entry's geolocation).","title":"Basic Usage"},{"location":"usage/#basic-usage","text":"jrnl has two modes: composing and viewing .
